###Ladda
*   A UI concept which merges loading indicators into the action that invoked them.
*   isight uses it in via the jQuery.ladda library

## Secret (auth, Connect auth in particular, but encryption in general)
*   Essentially salt for the hash

###Serialization
*   converting an object into a stream of bytes in order to store the object or transmit
    it to memory, a database, or a file. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object
    in order to be able to recreate it when needed. The reverse process is called deserialization.

### Etag

*   opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at
		a URL. If the resource representation at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag
		is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are similar to fingerprints, and they can be
		quickly compared to determine whether two representations of a resource are the same.

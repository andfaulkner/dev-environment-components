Libraries
=========
ESSENTIALS
----------
*   mocha                 
*   chai
*   enzyme
*   babel-register

Karma
-----
*   karma:                 test runner
*   karma-mocha:           adapter that lets Karma use MochaJS as its testing framework
*   karma-chai:            adapter that lets Karma use Chai as its assertion library
*   karma-sinon:           adapter that lets Karma use Sinon for HTTP route testing
*   karma-webpack:         allows KarmaJS to hook into Webpack & e.g .preprocess Typescript code
                           before executing the test code.
*   karma-mocha-reporter:  KarmaJS has a concept of “reporters” which at a high level represents
                           how the test results will be displayed on screen. Different reporters
                           provide a different look and feel. This plugin isn’t technically
                           required, it just makes the experience nicer.

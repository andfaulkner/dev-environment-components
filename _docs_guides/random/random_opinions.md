*   Light themes are every bit as awful as dark IDE themes are fucking awesome. Dark IDE themes are like being a badass mofo hacker coding your way out
    of the matrix. Light IDE are like being a redundant cog at a Java-worshipping McCodeshop adding a pointless non-feature to some "web-scale enterprise
    solutions as a service" that no one understands or cares about enough to even try.
    *   If light IDE themes could code, they'd do nothing but churning out Java, XML, XSL, COBOL, and crap-quality Windows-grade C++ straight out of DLL Hell.
        I bet dark themes would use Lisp, Haskell, and Assembly, and nothing in between. They're probably all over Clojure right now.
        Then there's red themes. WTF is up with that? "Oh man, I could really go for some bleeding profusely out of my eyes! But aw shucks, I have to go to work and
        write code, guess it'll have to wait. Unless..." ...and red themes were born. Why do people keep making them? Does anyone fucking use them? Are they a cruel
        joke? Were they created for some "Uncle" contest where everyone starts out using the worst theme possible, and whoever tolerates it the longest and doesn't switch
        wins? WTF man, no explanation.
*   Monokai dark themes are seriously the best.
*   There is no God.
*   Conservatives are fucking morons.
*   New agers are annoying as fuck. They're so ultimately harmless, so they can do what they want.
*   All anti-vaxxers should be forcibly injected with polio.
*   Anti-choicers should all have a bowling ball surgically grafted into their stomach, then have it forcibly taken out without anaesthetic along with their gall bladder
    while getting stretched on the rack for 10 hours, then have 50% of their income thrown off a bridge and burned for the rest of their life. Karma, bitches.
*   Multicoloured popsicles are just straight-up awesome.
*   House and minimal are the most useful music ever. Repetitive enough that it's not constantly distracting but with just enough going on to keep you awake, fast enough
    to keep you energized, and always mixed together into 1,000,000-hour "one-giant-song" DJ sets so track switches don't break your flow.
    *   Plus they have the best drugs.
*   Drugs are actually kind of boring. Stimulants do almost the same things every time you take them, same with depressants, so the novelty is basically gone after one use.
    And hallucinogens are pretty cool and mind-blowing the first few times, but after that, it's like "oh, this palce again. Whatevs, been here, done all the things. Yawn,
    how long was this supposed to last again? Too bad I can't take a nap." And addictions are the most boring of all...it's just a pointless, repetitive extra chore you have to
    do however often the drug's half-life dictates, where if you don't do it you get a horrific, agonizing, long-lasting flu. Annoying.
    *   But good luck stopping once you're there. Oh, that includes coffee BTW. If you drink it every day, have fun if you ever try to stop (seriously, don't do it).

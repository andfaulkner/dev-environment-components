# Text adventure

*   I've always wanted to make one
*   Pages only reload based on concept of 'worlds'
  -   i.e. page reload only when you enter a new 'world'
  -   'worlds' are sets of 'rooms' - i.e. blocks of text describing a location & actions available
*   progress saved with user account
*   different actions provide points
*   should have actual ending
*   can view other players' points on leaderboard

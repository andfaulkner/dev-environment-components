# Wiki sound machine

*   restricted online (anti-)collaborative music-making app
*   Set of base sounds available on the site
*   for each 'song', can set tempo and settings for each individual sound
    -   for each sound in a 'song', can set:
        +   when they play, by clicking on boxes (a la Fruity Loops)
        +   volume
        +   pitch
    -   'sections' can be defined, where a section contains one instance of a set of defined sounds
        +   (again, like Fruity Loops)
*   everyone can edit every song
    -   ...but songs in certain 'state' can be downloaded
    -   changes can be 'reverted'
    -   reloadable songs from JSON settings - + exportable JSON settings?
    -   Maybe...people can upload new sounds?

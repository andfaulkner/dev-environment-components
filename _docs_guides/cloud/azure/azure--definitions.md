Azure Active Directory
======================
## Implicit flow
*   "Client-Side Flow"
*   a type of authorization flow
*   required access token is sent back to the client application without the need for an authorization request token
    *   no refresh tokens for long-lived access are returned
*   use this flow for client-side web applications (JavaScript clients) that need temp access (a few hours) to the user’s data
*   [OAuth2: The implicit flow](https://labs.hybris.com/2012/06/05/oauth2-the-implicit-flow-aka-as-the-client-side-flow/)

## Active directory

## Active Directory Application
*   global representation of your application
    *   contains the credentials (application ID + either a password or certificate)
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal

## Application ID URI
*   identifier for an application
*   sent to Azure AD during authentication to indicate which app the caller wants a token for
    *   also included in the token so that the application knows it was the intended target

## Azure Active Directory tenant

## Claims
*   assertions of information about a subject that has been authenticated
    *   can be used by an application for various tasks e.g.
        *   to validate the token
        *   identify the subject's directory tenant
        *   display user information
        *   determine the subject's authorization
*   claims present in any given security token are dependent upon:
    *   the type of token
    *   the type of credential used to authenticate the user
    *   the application configuration

## Client ID
*   ID for an application
*   generated by Azure AD when the application is registered
*   When requesting an auth code or token, the client ID & key are sent to Azure AD during authentication

## Identity provider
*   an identity provider is responsible for verifying the identity of users and applications that exist in an organization’s directory.
    *   Issues security tokens upon successful authentication of those users and applications.

## Implicit Flow


## Key (Azure Active Directory)
*   The key that is sent along with a client ID when authenticating to Azure AD to call a web API

## Reply URL
*   

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Resource
*   manageable item that is available through Azure
*   Examples: web app, database, storage account, virtual machine, virtual network,
*   See a whole bunch of them and explore them all together at the Azure Resource Explorer:
    https://resources.azure.com/
*   video on resource explorer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye9eOYRK3jE

## Resource group
*   container that holds related resources for an Azure solution
*   can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you
    want to manage as a group

## Reply URL, Redirect URI
*   in a web API or webapp:
    *   Reply URL is the location to which Azure AD will send the authentication response
        *   This includes a token if an authentication was successful
*   redirect URI is only relevant to native applications


## Resource provider

## Resource manager tag
*   Tagging feature provided by resource manager enables you to categorize resources according to
    your requirements for managing or billing
*   Example: tag all resources that belong to the same department
*   tags consist of key/value pairs that identify resources with properties that you define

## Service principal

## Azure Resource manager

## Policies

## Batch accounts

## Azure Batch
*   schedules compute-intensive work to run on a managed collection of virtual machines
*   intended for computing tasks requiring ultra-high-performance and massive parallelism
    *

## What is it?

-   Fully managed service that makes it easy for devs to public, maintain, monitor, & secure APIs

-   Basically a doorway into your AWS environment.

-   Lets you create an API that acts as a front door for apps to access data,
    services, business logic, etc from your backend services e.g.:
    -   Code running on AWS Lambda
    -   Any web application
    -   Applications running on EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)

---

## What can it do?

-   Expose API endpoints to define a RESTful API
-   Serverlessly connect to devices like Lambda & DynamoDB
-   Send different API endpoints to different target
    -   e.g. 1 to a web application, 1 to Lambda, etc.
-   Track & control usage by API key.
-   Throttle requests to prevent an attack.
-   Connect to CloudWatch to log all requests for monitoring.
-   Maintain multiple versions of your API.

It also scales & runs efficiently.

;; Expand macros (mostly to debug them)

(println (macroexpand '(noop))) ; #=> nil

(println (noop 3 1 23 4))

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Background

; Macros are evaluated before runtime. Program execution order:
;   macros expanded --> code executed (including macro-generated code)

; Remember: each item of code is a piece of data. e.g.
; (+ 1 2)   <<< a data structure containing 3 items: +, 1, and 2

; Code is data, and macros are data transformation operations done on this data

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Key components

;-------------------------
; Quotes
;    Prevent code from being evaluated to work with it as data. i.e. flip the
;    interpreter into "data mode", treating the next s-exp as a data structure
;    rather than evaluating it right away.

'(+ 1 9)
; => (+ 1 9)

(quote (+ 1 9))
; => (+ 1 9)

;-------------------------
; Eval
;    Actually execute code stored as data

(def addition-op-1 '(+ 1 9))
(println addition-op-1)
; => (+ 1 9)

(eval addition-op-1)
; => 10

;-------------------------
; Syntax-quote & Unquote
;    Tells reader to treat expression as data (same as quote special form), but
;    it also fully qualifies all symbols, e.g. expanding + to clojure.core/+
;    Also allows for 'unquoting' parts of the expression viaÂ the ~

; replace nil with an empty string. Not actually that useful, Clojure handles nil just fine.
(defmacro de-nil
  [arg]
  `(cond
      (= ~arg nil) ""   ; tilde (~) causes arg to bind at runtime rather than compile-time 
      :else ~arg))

;-------------------------
; splicing unquote: ~@  
;   lets us eval an expression just like normal unquote, with 2 differences:
;     1) it expects result of eval to be a list or seq
;     2) the result gets spliced into the outer list the unquoted list was present in. 
;        E.g. it "explodes" the list sexp

;    I think of the ~@ here like a fuse attached to a Legend of Zelda-style bomb.
;    Compile-time lights the wick, but the bomb only explodes at runtime. This blasts
;    open one of the walls of the sexp, and the values escape into the sexp outside.
;    Together with their new friends they tear down their old sexp home, then they all
;    hold hands and sing kum-bae-yah, for they are a family now.

(defmacro one-two-and-some-grump
  [arg]
  `(list 1 2 ~arg)) ; => (1 2 (3 4))

(defmacro one-two-and-friends
  [arg]
  `(list 1 2 ~@arg))
; => (1 2 3 4)


;-------------------------
; gensym and #
; use # within ` to produce a gensym for each symbol automatically

(defmacro define-x-hygenically []
  `(do
     (def x# 2)
     (list x#)))


; (defn replace-underscore 
;   [form new-val]
;   (map #(cond (= % '_) new-val :else %) form))


; (defmacro ->>>
;   [init & forms]

; 
; *** IMPORTANT GOTCHA WITH MACROS ***
;   Variables used in a macro are bound at the point where the macro is
;   declared, NOT at the point where the macro is used

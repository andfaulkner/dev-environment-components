INTRODUCTION                                                          *jshint*

This plugin is a front for JSHint.

This plugin will allow you to run JSHint from vim, and shows the results in 
a split window.

:JSHint {file}                                                       *:JSHint*

    Test {file} with jshint.
    If {file} not provided it uses current file.

    Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| 
    window for you. 

Hints found in file will be listed in the split window, along with the 
line and column number. 

<Enter> on a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on 
the matching line.

Press 'o' in a line in |Quickfix| will open the file in a new window and place
the cursor on the matching line.

Pressing 'go' will do a preview (open but maintain focus on jshint results)

Press 'q' to close |Quickfix| window.

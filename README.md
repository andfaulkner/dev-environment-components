# sublime-dev-environment-snippets

Collection of personal dev tools, development workflow improvements, convenience scripts,
code snippets, templates, guides, manuals, and utilities.

Centers around Javascript (both client-side and NodeJS), Ruby, and Bash, along with with quite a bit of Clojure, (S)CSS, HTML, and SQL. Apparently this makes me a hipster dev (I prefer the term "alpha geek", but haters gonna hate).
Also has some stuff on Python and Java (Android), and touches on Common Lisp.

# Contents:
*   Huge collection of Sublime snippets
    *   including "meta-snippets" for writing snippets
*   Terminal-accessible "manuals" for quick reference (without leaving the command line)
*   Collection of mini-guides & example sets for several languages, frameworks, and tools
    *   ...along with a few "toy" projects demonstrating and prototyping certain concepts, features, and tools.
*   Variety of free programming books in PDF form
*   Convenience scripts (see below)
*   Development environment setup tools and plugins
    *   including some locally stored vim plugins
*   certain user-level configuration files such as .pryrc, .rubocop.yml, .irbrc, .npmrc, .vimrc, etc. (with all sensitive information removed and declared outside this repo)

## Contains scripts for...
*   setting up new development environments on new machines.
*   starting new projects of various types
*   performing common system chores (lots of Rake, standalone Ruby, and bash scripts in here)
    *   relatedly, simplifying tedious command line tasks
    *   also relatedly, declaring command line aliases
*   handling certain database operations
*   manipulating Android location data via telnet
*   etc.

This is a large, messy dumping ground that helps keep my dev environment synced across all
machines I work off of.

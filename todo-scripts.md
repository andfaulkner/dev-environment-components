Ruby scripts to create
======================

-   save your git branch history to a file. Output them to the cli when a command is given. 
    Store a specific number based on a config file. Have a default number of past branches to
    output, along with an option for this in the config. Allow display of a specific number based
    on a property given to the script

-   create the same branch on both main and base. First check out develop on each, then if both 
    checkouts succeed, create a branch with the given name on each. Otherwise return an error.

General scripting tasks
=======================
-   Figure out how to get Clojure up and running
